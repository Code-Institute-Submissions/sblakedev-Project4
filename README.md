Agile Workflow
The Agile workflow was used in creating this site. Tasks were prioritised by using GitHub Issues and assigning User Stories to those Issues.

Design
Colour Scheme
The main colours used are Red and white. This Red ties in well with the theme of a burger restaurant, as thanks to McDonald's it suggests a casual eatery. The White suggests clean and fresh which is what the restaurant wants customers to think of.

Font
The font is clear and casual which again, ties in with the relaxed atmosphere of the restaurant.

Images
Images used show tasty, fresh burgers to show users what the main dish is.

Wireframes

Database Schema
The database design is seen below. The Booking model has a relationship with the built-in Django model of User through the foreign key

Features
Navbar
The navbar shows all of the sections of the site at first glance. By clicking on one of the tabs, it will take the user further down the page to the corresponding section.

Hero Section
The hero section clearly shows the type of food on offer at this estabishment and features a button to Book a Table.

About Section
The about section allows the user to learn more about the restaurant, when it was established, what their mission is. It also provides the phone number to call to book a table.

Menu Section
The menu section shows all of the dishes on offer. There are Burgers, Fries, Drinks and Desserts tabs which when clicked show what's available in each category. The ingredients used in each dish are underneath the name and is followed by the price, so that users have all the information available to them before they decide to book a table.

Testimonials Section
The testimonials section features quotes from people who have eaten at the restautant before so that users can see other opinions before they decide to book a table.

Staff Section
The staff section features pictures of 3 main staff in the restaurant. This means that users can feel like they know a bit more about the staff and what their values are. This may make the user feel more comfortable in the restaurant.

Gallery
The gallery section features some photos of the restaurant. Again, this helps the user feel like they know the restaurant before they've ever been there and may help them feel morea comfortable.

Contact
The contact section features the address, email address, phone number and opening hours of the restaurant.

Footer
The footer section features the contact information again and also links to social media. These links open the homepage of those sites in a new tab.

Account Sign Up
The account sign up section features a form that the user can fill in in order to create an account.

Login
The login section allows the user to log in.

Booking Page
The booking page allows the user to create a booking using the form. This will then appear in the user's My Bookings page

My Bookings
This page shows the user's current booking. From here, the user can edit or delete a booking by clicking on the corresponding button.

Delete Booking
When the user clicks the Delete button, a warning message will appear so that the user can confirm if they want to delete the booking or not.

Bugs
After creating models, I can't see the email field when creating a new booking in the admin panel.
